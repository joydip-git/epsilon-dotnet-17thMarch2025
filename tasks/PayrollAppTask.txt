create console app: PayrollApp

Add a class file: Developer.cs with a class inside it: Developer

Developer class structure:
	Data Members:
		id (int) -> should be assigned ONLY through constructor
		name (string)
		basicPay (decimal)
		daPay (decimal)
		hraPay (decimal)
		incentivePay (decimal)
		totalPay (decimal) -> will be set by a method, will NOT be passed from outside the class

	Constructors:
		default ctor
		parameterized ctor -> will assign value to all data members, except the "totalPay"
	
	Properties:
		Id for id -> readonly property
		Name for name
		BasicPay for basicPay
		DaPay for daPay
		HraPay for hraPay
		IncentivePay for incentivePay
		TotalPay for totalPay -> readonly property
		
	Functionalities:
		CalculateSalary:
			arguments: NA
			return value: void

in the Main method of Program class in Program.cs, create at least one object of each class and assign the values to the data members. Then calculate the total pay and then print the same.

Note: 
	accept all the values from user
	create the object in separate method. the method will create the instance and return the instance to the Main method.
	In the main method you will calculate the total pay and print the same

Now, Add one more class file: Hr.cs with a class inside it: Hr

Hr class structure:
	Data Members:
		id (int) -> should be assigned ONLY through constructor
		name (string)
		basicPay (decimal)
		daPay (decimal)
		hraPay (decimal)
		gratuityPay (decimal)
		totalPay (decimal) -> will be set by a method, will NOT be passed from outside the class

	Constructors:
		default ctor
		parameterized ctor -> will assign value to all data members, except the "totalPay"
	
	Properties:
		Id for id -> readonly property
		Name for name
		BasicPay for basicPay
		DaPay for daPay
		HraPay for hraPay
		GratuityPay for gratuityPay
		TotalPay for totalPay -> readonly property
		
	Functionalities:
