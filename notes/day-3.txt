Inheritance:
	a. single-level
		A <- B
	b. multi-level
		A <- B <- C
	c. multiple
		A, B <- C

Note: Child class can't be more accessible than its base class
	i.e. if the base class is internal, child class can't be public

ctor execution sequence in inheritance:
when any child class ctor is called, automatically base class's default ctr is invoked implicitly
