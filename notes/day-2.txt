object creation:
1. runtime looks into the class and finds out the data members and their data types
2. runtime allocates memory blocks in the heap for those data member values to be stored
3. then runtime invokes the constructor (the one which you have used in the code)
   the constructor assigns values (Default or user-defined) to those data members (these values are stored in those memory blocks)
4. the runtime returns the initial memory address (reference) to that object and that reference is stored in the reference variable of the class as declared by you in the code

? => with value type => Nullable type
  => with reference type => null check
